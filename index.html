                    <p>Quotas are used to limit the amount of disk space a user or group can use on a filesystem.
                        Without
                        such limits, a user could fill up the machine’s disk and cause problems for other users and
                        services.
                    <ol>
                        <!-- step 1 -->

                        </li>
                        <p>Install the quota package by using your linux distrubution package manager i.e apt, yum or
                            dnf
                            and pacman,

                            <h3>Updating filesystem mount options</h3>
                        </li>
                        <p>To activate quotas on a particular filesystem, you need to mount it with a few quota-related
                            options specified. You can do this by updating the filesystem’s entry in the /etc/fstab
                            configuration file</p>
                        <p>Update the line pointing to the root filesystem by replacing the defaults option with the
                            appending usrquota,grpquota options using nano or vim editor</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Remount the filesystem to make the new options take effect</p>
                        <div class="code">$ sudo mount -o remount /</div>

                            <h3>checking and enabling quotas</h3>
                        </li>
                        <p>Before finally turning on the quota system, you need to manually run the quotacheck command
                            once
                        </p>
                        <div class="code">$ sudo quotacheck -ug /</div>
                        <p>This command creates the files /aquota.user and /aquota.group. These files contain
                            information
                            about the limits and usage of the filesystem, and they need to exist before you turn on
                            quota

                            <li>u: specifies that a user-based quota file should be created</li>
                            <li>g: indicates that a group-based quota file should be created</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Now Enable or turn on the quota system</p>

                        <div class="code">$ sudo quotaon -v /</div>

                            <h3>Using quotas</h3>
                        </li>
                        <p>There are a few ways you can set quotas for users or groups. Here, you’ll go over how to set
                            quotas with both the edquota and setquota commands</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Set a User Quota</li>
                            <ol>
                                <!-- first way -->
                                <li>By using edquota</li>
                                <p>Use the edquota command to edit quotas</p>
                                <div class="code">$ sudo edquota -u [username]</div>
                                <p>The -u option specifies that this is a user quota you’ll be editing. If you’d like to
                                    edit a
                                    group’s quota instead, use the -g option in its place.</p>
                                <p>Save and close the file. To check the new quota you can use the quota command</p>
                                <div class="code codespace-down">$ sudo quota -vs [username]</div>

                                <!-- second way -->
                                <li>By using setquota </li>
                                <p>Unlike edquota, setquota will update your user’s quota information in a single
                                    command,
                                    without
                                    an interactive editing step. You will specify the username and the soft and hard
                                    limits
                                    for both
                                    block- and inode-based quotas, and finally the filesystem to apply the quota to</p>
                                <div class="code codespace-down">$ sudo setquota -u [username] 500M 700M 0 0 /</div>

                                This backup strategy involves a backup of the complete file system on a weekly,

                                or other periodic basis

                            <li>Full Backups with Incremental Backups</li>
                            <p>
                                This scheme involves performing a full backup of the entire system once a week, along
                                with a daily incremental backup of only those files that have changed in the previous
                                day.


                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This backup scheme can be advanced in two ways. In one way, each incremental backup
                                can be made with reference to the original full backup. In other words, a level 0 backup
                                is
                                followed by a series of level 1 backups. The benefit of this backup scheme is that a
                                restoration requires only two tapes (the full backup and the most recent incremental
                                backup).

                                Modern commercial backup applications such as Amanda and BRU assist in organizing
                                the process of managing complex backup schedules and tracking backup media. Doing it
                                yourself using the classic dump or employing shell scripts to run tar requires that the
                                system administrator handle all the organization himself. For this reason, complex
                                backup
                                situations are typically handled with commercial software and specialized hardware prod-
                                ucts that are packaged, sold, and supported by vendors.

                                RAID stands for Redundant array of inexpensive disks or redundant array of independent
                                disks that can mirror a disk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that RAID arrays and mirroring systems are just as happy to write corrupt data as
                                valid data. Moreover, if a file is deleted, a RAID array does not save it. RAID arrays
                                are best
                                suited for protecting the current state of a running system, not for providing backups.
