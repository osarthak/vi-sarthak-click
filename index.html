                    <p>Quotas are used to limit the amount of disk space a user or group can use on a filesystem.
                        Without
                        such limits, a user could fill up the machine’s disk and cause problems for other users and

                                <li>By using edquota</li>
                                <p>Use the edquota command to edit quotas</p>
                                <div class="code">$ sudo edquota -u [username]</div>
                                <p>The -u option specifies that this is a user quota you’ll be editing. If you’d like to
                                    edit a
                                    group’s quota instead, use the -g option in its place.</p>
                                <p>Save and close the file. To check the new quota you can use the quota command</p>

                                <p>Unlike edquota, setquota will update your user’s quota information in a single

                                    without

                                    limits
                                    for both
                                    block- and inode-based quotas, and finally the filesystem to apply the quota to</p>

                                In this Strategy we take backup of the configurations files on a usb-stick, you should
                                archive each user’s home

                                as well as the entire /etc directory. Between the two, that backup would contain most of
                                the important files for a small system. Then you can easily restore this data from the
                                backup media device you have chosen, after a complete reinstall of Fedora, if necessary.

                                This scheme involves performing a full backup of the entire system once a week, along
                                with a daily incremental backup of only those files that have changed in the previous

                                This backup scheme can be advanced in two ways. In one way, each incremental backup
                                can be made with reference to the original full backup. In other words, a level 0 backup
                                is
                                followed by a series of level 1 backups. The benefit of this backup scheme is that a
                                restoration requires only two tapes (the full backup and the most recent incremental
                                backup).

                                Modern commercial backup applications such as Amanda and BRU assist in organizing
                                the process of managing complex backup schedules and tracking backup media. Doing it
                                yourself using the classic dump or employing shell scripts to run tar requires that the
                                system administrator handle all the organization himself. For this reason, complex

                    rather than to create an archive of them</p>

                <p>
                    Using tar is
                    the traditional choice because older versions of cp did not handle symbolic links and
                    permissions well at times, causing those attributes (characteristics of the file) to be lost;
                    tar handled those file attributes in a better manner. cp has been improved to fix those
                    problems, but tar is still more widely used.

                    <p>One choice for copying files into another location is to use the tar command where you
                        would create a tar file that would be piped to tar to be uncompressed in the new loca-
                        tion.</p>

                        <li>
                            c — Create an archive.
                        </li>
                        <li>v — Be Verbose; lists the files processed so we can see that it is working.</li>
                        <li>f — Use the filename of the archive will be what follows. (In this case, it is -.)</li>
                        <li>- — Use a buffer; a place to hold data temporarily.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><h2>Compressing, Encrypting, and Sending tar Streams</h2></li>
                    <p>The file copy techniques using the tar command in the previous section can also be used
                        to quickly and securely copy a directory structure across a LAN or the Internet (using the
                        ssh command). </p>
                    <p>
                        One way to make use of these techniques is to use the following
                        command line to first compress the contents of a designated directory, and then decom-
                        press the compressed and encrypted archive stream into a designated directory on a
                        remote host
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The tar command is used to create, list, and compress the files in the directory named
                        data_folder. The output is piped through the ssh (secure shell) command and sent to
                        the remote computer named remote_host. On the remote computer, the stream is then
                        extracted and saved in the directory named /mybackup_dir. You are prompted for a pass-
                        word to send the stream.

                            -p — Preserves all file attributes if possible. (File ownership might interfere.)

                        <li>
